### Python Library for accessing SmartCity middleware

#### Some basics
---

- A device can be broadly classified into 3 types: sensor,actuator,application
- 'Sensors' publish data to the middleware, 'actuators' subscribes to data from middleware and 'applications' can both publish and subscribe
- A device is recognised by a 'resource_id', eg: iiot_light_sensor_101
